# Introductory part
Hi all! My friends and I wanted to play poker. After looking at the prices for the sets, we were a little shocked. The price for a 14 gram chip in the middle price category was 20 rubles. The main argument not to buy such a set was the reasoning that, after playing for a few days, we would leave this set and not use it again. As a result, we decided to make the chips ourselves, and if we get together often, then buy a professional set.

# Materials
I used 2mm binding cardboard as a base for the chips. I bought it from a store that specializes in packaging materials. I also know that Leonardo sells binding cardboard, but since I buy in large sheets (1050 mm by 920 mm), it costs about 10 rubles for an A4 sheet. In comparison, in Leonardo 30 mm by 30 mm - 51 rubles, 20 mm by 30 mm - 36 rubles (prices at the end of 2022).

The paper I used was self-adhesive glossy photo paper DEXP Deluxe Gloss with a density of 115 g/m^2 (As an alternative, you can use photo paper from Revcol. I didn’t buy the self-adhesive one, but I liked their double-sided photo paper)

I used 100 micron glossy lamination film from Aceline

PVA glue - Moment joiner

# Manufacturing technology
We print two sheets of chips. I used the standard Canon PIXMA G1416 printer preset: plain paper, regular quality. I tried to set glossy paper in the settings, the printer prints with too dark colors (where there should be a blue color, it prints almost blue), but for me it was important that the center of the chip be much lighter than its edges. And when set up with plain paper, the printer prints almost the same colors as the monitor outputs.

We cut along the contour, connect and pass through the laminator. It turns out that the front parts of the photo paper are laminated, but at the same time we can easily peel off the protective film from the back.

Glue one part onto the binding cardboard. Cut along the contour. We add the second one. We get a sheet with 35 chips.
In order to start cutting, you need to make notches along the edges of the sheet using a stationery knife.

Apply a ruler and carefully cut out. I recommend cutting across the sheet, because... on a longer segment it is easier to make a mistake, move and ruin one or more chips.

Next, we get strips of 5 chips each and do the same with the notches.

After you have cut out a certain number of chips, I recommend gluing their edges with PVA so that the laminate does not begin to peel off from the paper. It takes too long to glue each one separately, so I took about 10 pieces in a stack and coated them all together, while squeezing them tightly together, because. if you don’t do this, the glue will get between the chips and not only will it be difficult to separate them, but there will also be a white trace of glue left on the chip itself. If such a plaque does appear, you can carefully remove it with your fingernail, without harming the laminate. After you glue the pack of chips, you will need to lay them out one at a time and wait until the glue dries, otherwise the chips will stick together.

The dealer's chip is made like a regular chip, but 3 layers of binding cardboard are used, glued together.

# Cost of these chips
( 1$ ≈ 100rubles )
2 self-adhesive sheets of photo paper: 2 * 10 = 20 rubles
Lamination film: 10 rubles
Binding cardboard: 1050 mm by 920 mm (15 A4 sheets can be cut) - 170 rubles --> 1 A4 sheet - 11 rubles
Glue and printer ink are taken into account when calculating, because... I don't know how to implement this correctly.
Total 41 rubles for one sheet with 35 chips --> 1.2 rubles - the cost of one chip.

# Why certain decisions were made
The contours between the chips are missing due to the fact that it is impossible (at least for me) to cut two sheets with identical length and width. One sheet will still be larger than the other by a couple of tenths of a millimeter (and sometimes a whole millimeter). Then, when cutting along a line on one side, on the other this line will be shifted. You will have to turn the chip over and remove the strip. And if you consider that this will need to be done with several hundred chips, doing without a line between them sounds more logical.

The chips themselves are square to make cutting easier. It is almost impossible to make them completely round (of course it is possible, but at the same time, one chip will take a colossal amount of time, and this type of chips was invented solely for familiarization with the game, and not as a full-fledged replacement for the chips that are on the market today). For the same reason, a square shape was adopted rather than a 6- or 8-corner one.

Glossy paper is used for better color rendition, as well as for the most dense adhesion to the laminate. (When I cut out chips for one PNP with a diameter of 1 cm on matte paper, sometimes the laminate completely peeled off from the chip. I didn’t notice such a problem on glossy paper)

# Required number of chips and my observations
On the Internet they write that to play you need:
100 chips - for playing together
200 chips - 3-4 players
300 chips - 5-6 players
500 chips - 7-10 players

To begin with, I printed two sheets (i.e. 70 chips) of denominations 5, 25, 50, 100 and one sheet each (35 chips) of 500 and 1000. A total of 350 chips, i.e. Should be enough for a game with 6. You can print more and increase the number of chips at any time.

During the game, it was noticed that chips with a face value of 5 are optional, because you can start with blinds of 25/50 and feel comfortable (in the sense that you have enough chips).

We used a starting stack of 5000 chips (100BB) and initial blinds of 25/50. You can use 2500 (50BB). When the blinds increased, non-playing chips were replaced, for example, with blinds of 50/100, you can remove chips with a face value of 25 (provided that the next blinds are 100/200, and not 75/150, which is also the case)
I cannot give an optimal division of chips between players, because... for each case, the division may be different (depending on how much time you want to play and how many participants).

I can only give an example from myself:
3 players, T5000 tournament (i.e. starting stack of 5000 chips) starting blinds 25/50. After 15 minutes they increase to 50/100, 100/200, 200/400 and so on.
Number of chips per player: "25" - 10 pieces, "50" - 11 pieces, "100" - 12 pieces, "500" - 4 pieces, "1000" - 1 piece.
Average playing time is 1.5-2 hours.

Good luck and have fun playing!
